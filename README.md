Quadratic Extensions of Prime order Fields - Formalization in Coq

opam install coq-prime


**FourQ.v**

A formal specification of the curve FourQ (see https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/565.pdf)

**QuadraticFieldExtensions.v**

A specification of quadratic extensions of finite fields (as defined in Coqprime.GZnZ) of order p, where p is a prime number with p mod 4 = 3.

**RingsUtil.v and FieldsUtil.v**

Contain a few results on rings and fields respectively.

    - It is shown that fields and rings of prime order p and their quadratic extensions have characteristic p (as defined in Crypto.Algebra.Ring)

    - it is shown that a set with operations satisfying the "field_theory" (or ring_theory) of the standard library is an instance of the field (or ring) class of Crypto.Algebra.Hierarchy.

    - The groups of units of a finite fields is constructed, and it is shown to have order q - 1, where q is the order of the field.


**RepeatedSquaring**

Contains an algorithm to do exponentiation in monoids via repeated squaring.

**SquareTest**

Verifies that an element, x, of a finite field is not a square, if x^(q - 1)/2 is not 1, where q is the order of the field.
